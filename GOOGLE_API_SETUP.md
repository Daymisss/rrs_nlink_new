3. Copy the generated key
4. Click "RESTRICT KEY"
5. Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key"

You now have all the credentials needed. Here's what you should have:

```
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=123456789-abc123.apps.googleusercontent.com
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-abcd1234efgh5678
GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN=1//04abcd1234efgh...
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY=AIzaSyAbc123... (if using Option B)
COMPANY_EMAIL=roofingreliable.nz@gmail.com
```

## STEP 7: Add to Your Project

1. **In your Blink project**:
   - Go to your project settings
   - Add these as environment variables/secrets
   - Never put these directly in your code!

2. **Test the integration**:
   - Your booking system should now be able to:
     - Send emails via Gmail
     - Create calendar events
     - Sync appointments

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "This app isn't verified"
- **Solution**: Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to [your app] (unsafe)" during OAuth flow

**Issue**: "redirect_uri_mismatch"  
- **Solution**: Make sure you added exactly `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground` to authorized redirect URIs

**Issue**: "insufficient_scope"
- **Solution**: Make sure you selected both Gmail and Calendar scopes in OAuth Playground

**Issue**: "invalid_client"
- **Solution**: Double-check your Client ID and Secret are entered correctly in OAuth Playground
